# PrestaShop Coupon Module

This module is designed for use within your PrestaShop platform. Begin by creating a new discount in your shop, 
ensuring you assign a code and discount amount. Without these, customers will be unable to apply the discount. 
Next, download and zip the folder coupon, upload it, and navigate to the configuration page. 
Enter the Cart Rule ID of the discount you wish to display. Additionally, you can adjust the display duration, 
the interval between coupon displays, the additional message you want to convey to your customers, and the background color to your preference.
