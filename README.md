# PrestaShop Coupon Module

This module is designed for use within your PrestaShop platform. Begin by creating a new discount in your shop, 
ensuring to assign a code and discount amount. Without these, customers will be unable to apply the discount. 
Next, download and upload the module, navigate to the configuration page, and enter the Cart Rule ID of the discount you wish to display. 
Additionally, you can adjust the display duration, the interval between coupon displays, 
additional message you want to convey to your customers and the background color to your preference.
